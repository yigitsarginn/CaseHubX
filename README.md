# RETRO

First of all, I must confess that I had fun working on this case. Almost every scenario that was under my responsibility in my previous job was present in the case. One who hasn't worked with React Native might consider the case simple, but it was a challenging case with many intricate details. The biggest challenge I faced was the infiniteness of what I wanted to achieve. In the Onboarding, there were Scanner animations, objects around the image swirling with a tornado effect, sliding carousels, and countless other Reanimated details. Rest assured, I believe I can do even better.

I tried to establish a dynamic structure to the best of my ability. I hope everything is going well for you too.
